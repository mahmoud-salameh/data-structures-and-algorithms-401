## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

* contains
* hash
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### The functions [__add__ __get__ __contains__ and __hash__
all have __Big O__ of 
* time ---> O(n) 
* space ---> O(1)
]
