# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

* Vertex : A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge :An edge is a connection between two nodes.
* Neighbor : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
* Degree : The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
* add node 
* add edge 
* get nodes 
* get neighbors 
* size

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* add_node :
  * time : O(1)
  * space : O(1)

* add_edge:
  * time : O(n)
  * space : O(n)

* get_nodes :
  * time: O(n)
  * space: O(n)

* get_neighbors:
  * time: O(n)
  * space: O(n)

* size :
  * time: O(1)
  * space: O(1)
