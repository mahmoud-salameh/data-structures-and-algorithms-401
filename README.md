# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
##  Linked List
* Create a Linked List class
* Within your Linked List class, include a head property. 
    * Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* The class should contain the following methods 
    * insert
        * Arguments: value
        * Returns: nothing
        * Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    * includes 
        * Arguments: value
        * Returns: Boolean 
            * 
    Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

    * to string 
        * Arguments: none
        * Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        * "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

<!-- ## Approach & Efficiency
What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach?

# code challenge -11
# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface.

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
enqueue

Ceate method called enqueue, check if the value is empty if it is return please put a value, if not use stack class method push to push the value to self.front

Big O :

    time : O(1)
    space : O(1)

dequeue

Ceate method called dequeue, check if the queue is empty if it is return The Queue is empty, create while loop while self.front.top become none, while looping push in self.rear (self.front.pop()), declear varible = self.rear.pop(), create another loop while self,rear.top become None , while looping push self.front self.rear.pop(), return dequeuevalue

Big O :

    time : O(n)
    space : O(1)


# code challenge -12

## Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
* The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods: 
    * enqueue
        * Arguments: animal 
            * animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
    * dequeue
        * Arguments: pref 
            * pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
enqueue

enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

Big O :
* time : O(n)
* space : O(n)

dequeue

dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

Big O :

* time : O(n)

* space : O(n)






# code challenge -13

## Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
write a function that  should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are  balanced.
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
![](code-challenges/challenge13.png)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
create a function called the_paren_balanced, check if is balance = true, check if the length of the string is balanced, check if the stack is empty if it's empty return false, if the stack is balanced and not empty return true, then create a new function to check if the paren is matching  and put in it to argu a1 an a2 and if a1 = a2 in each case return true if not return false

Big O:
time ---> O(n)
space ---> O(n)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create method called max_in_tree and declare variable max = 0 Create function call traversal take a node as argument inside it it will check if there is left node and check if there is right node inside  every check i will call the function again and check if the value of the  node more than the max value if it is the value of the node will be the new max value, for first time we will call the function with the root, at end check if the value of the root more than max if it is the max will be the root value.
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
input = tree in the visualization
Expected output = 23

self.max=0
traverse(Node(3))

if Node(4): True
 traverse(Node(4))
...
if Node(11): True
   traverse(Node(11))
...

if 3 > 23 #False

return 23




# code challenge -17
## Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called breadth first that take an Arguments: tree and then Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
![](code-challenges/challenge-17.png)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create function called breadth_first
declare to list in_queue =[tree.root], breadth=[]
check if the tree is empty if it is return []
create while while queue != None
while looping let the node = queue[0]
check if there is left and right if it is add it to the queue add the value of queue[0] to breadth
remove the first index from queue
after the loop break return breadth list
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
input = tree in the pic
Expected output = [3, 4, 11, 1, 13, 19, 23]

queue = [Node(3)]
breadth=[]

if Node(4) != None: True
 queue += [Node(4)]
if Node(11) != None: True
     queue += [Node(11)]
breadth+=[1]
queue=[Node(4),Node(11)]
...

return [3, 4, 11, 1, 13, 19, 23]
